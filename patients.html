<h3>1. Knee and Hip Joint at a Glance</h3>
<p>The knee and hip joints are major weight-bearing joints in the body that enable movement and flexibility. These joints are lined with cartilage that helps in smooth motion and shock absorption.</p>

<h3>2. What is Arthritis?</h3>
<p>Arthritis refers to inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Over time, it can lead to joint damage and loss of function.</p>

<h3>4. Commonly Affected Joints and Their Symptoms</h3>
<p>Knees, hips, hands, and spine are commonly affected. Symptoms include pain, swelling, stiffness, reduced range of motion, and joint deformity in severe cases.</p>
